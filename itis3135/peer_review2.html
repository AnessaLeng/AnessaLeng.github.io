        <h3>Checklist</h3>
        <ul id="checklist">
            <li><span class="topic">No spaces or upper-cases in file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc.: ☑️</span> Looks good!
            <li><span class="topic"><br><br>Design:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><br><span class="topic">Page has sufficient contrast/font sizing so as to be easy to read: ❌</span> While the contrast and font sizing effectively highlight the headers, the readability of the text and links could be improved.
                    <li><br><span class="topic">Page has site colors and fonts using the standard css file: ☑️</span> Yes, it does.
                    <li><br><span class="topic">CRAP:</span> 
                        <ul>
                            <li><br><span class="topic">Contrast: ❌</span> The selection of foreground and background color make the the text challenging to read.
                            <li><br><span class="topic">Repitition: ☑️</span> The consistency across all pages is commendable. However, the use of stars with bullet points on the Experience page might be slightly confusing. It may be more effective to choose a single style for sub-bullet points and maintain that throughout.
                            <li><br><span class="topic">Alignment: ☑️</span> There is good alignment across all pages.
                            <li><br><span class="topic">Proximity: ☑️</span> The spacing between the text and headers is well-executed. However, it may be beneficial to be aware of the considerable amount of white space on the right side of the Home and Experience pages.
