        <p>In the heart of our city, you will find a unique Chinese restaurant, a testament to resilience and the American dream. Over a decade ago, a courageous couple from Cambodia, fleeing the horrors of civil war, sought refuge on these shores. With little more than hope and a shared passion for cooking, they embarked on an incredible journey. They poured their hearts into creating House of Leng, infusing it with the flavors of their homeland and the lessons of their journey. More than 10 years later, their humble eatery has blossomed into a beloved local establishment. Their story is a poignant reminder of the power of perseverance, the strength of the human spirit, and the universal language of food. This is not just a restaurant; it is a symbol of triumph against adversity, a celebration of cultural fusion, and above all, a tribute to their enduring love and resilience. Welcome to our restaurant, where every dish tells a story. Welcome to our family.</p>
