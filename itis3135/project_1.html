        <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p>I plan to include a photo gallery on the homepage and the menu page. If possible, I wanted the images to be interactive, displaying the description of the food. There will also be a form on the contact us page, that will require javascript to submit. I wanted to do something similar to the BYO-introduction where after submitting the form, a different page overwrites the current one.</p>
